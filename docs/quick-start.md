# Quick Start

Megalodon is a chess engine which uses UCI protocol.
This means that it can communicate with a GUI, but cannot display a chess board by itself.

You will need a separate chess GUI program. Some common ones are listed below:

* Arena Chess
* Lucas Chess
* Cutechess

The Megalodon Developers are working on another chess GUI, [Hammerhead][hammerhead], but as of now it is not functional.

Download the [latest][latest] Megalodon version and a chess GUI.
Then, add Megalodon as an engine in the GUI, and you are ready to play it!
