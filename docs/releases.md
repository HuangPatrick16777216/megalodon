## [Megalodon 0.0.3][v0.0.3]

This release features improved board algorithms, which increase it's NPS (nodes per second) from 4000 to 8000.

The depth of calculation was also adjusted to 4, and Megalodon will think for about 30 seconds per move.

After this release, the Megalodon team will work on implementing bitboards.

This release includes updated searching algorithms and bug fixes.

## [Megalodon 0.0.1][v0.0.1]
